<!-- trying different themes from https://mpetroff.net/files/beamer-theme-matrix/
theme:
Copenhagen - too much at bottom
Frankfurt - shows progress bar at top (play with colours though), nothing at bottom.
Luebeck - awful (lists sections vertically at the top)
metropolis - too many borders
Rochester - slide title is in top border, but that's really big
Singapore - used for hake, slide title does take up a bit of room, looks good with lily

# Motivation

## Motivation

- Stock assessments need to `r colorize("communicate uncertainty")` of estimated quantities

- Often done through figures and tables depicting `r colorize("95\\% credible or confidence intervals")`

<!-- - Example: Pacific Hake assessment presents thousands of such intervals. Cannot
  show full estimated distributions for everything. -->

- We show that computing such intervals with the usual equal-tailed approach has
undesirable consequences

## Motivation

Regarding recent assessment results, a fisherman remarked:

\vspace{10mm}

\centering
*No offence to anyone, but my granddaughter could provide that amount of uncertainty.*

\vspace{10mm}

Highlights the need to investigate ways to reduce
uncertainty as much as possible.


# ETI

## Pacific Hake

```{r hakemap, echo=FALSE, out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(here::here(),
                               "/report/talks/hake-25-survey-cropped.png"))
```

## Pacific Hake stock assessment

- Biennial joint Canada/US coastwide survey (California to Haida Gwaii)

- Assessed, reviewed, and managed jointly with US NOAA colleagues

- Statistical catch-at-age model conducted in a Bayesian setting

\pause

- Marginal posterior distributions for numerous quantities

- Need to summarise these -- done using 95% credible intervals from  8000 Markov chain Monte Carlo samples


## Example plot that contains 305 credible intervals

```{r motivation, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(here::here(),
                               "report/talks/hake-25-fig-46.png"))
```

## Using 2001 recruitment as example

- estimate of number of age-0 fish in 2001
- based on the 8000 MCMC samples

```{r vector}
length(rec_2021)
summary(rec_2021)
rec_2021[1:20]
```

## Equal-tailed intervals for 2021 recruitment -- usual approach

```{r calc, echo = FALSE}
res_vec <- create_intervals(rec_2021)

set.seed(42)
vec_sub <- sample(rec_2021, 200)    # then can easily see the 5 at each end
res_sub <- create_intervals(vec_sub)
```

```{r eti1d2, echo = FALSE}
plot_pointwise_intervals(rec_2021,
                         res_vec,
                         jitter_amount = 0.01,
                         xlim = c(0, 42),
                         xlab = "Recruitment (billions of fish)")
```

## Equal-tailed intervals -- usual approach

```{r eti1, echo = FALSE}
plot(res_vec,
     type = "eti",
     xlim = c(0, 40),
     ylim = c(0, 0.11),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     xlab = "Recruitment (billions of age-0 fish)",
     arrowhead_gap = 0.1,
	 show_a_b = FALSE)
```

## Equal-tailed intervals -- usual approach

Values in range a are just as likely as values in range b.

But a is outside the ETI yet b is inside it.
```{r eti2, echo = FALSE}
plot(res_vec,
     type = "eti",
     xlim = c(0, 40),
     ylim = c(0, 0.11),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     xlab = "Recruitment (billions of age-0 fish)",
     arrowhead_gap = 0.1)
```

## Equal-tailed intervals -- usual approach

Values in range a are just as likely as values in range b.

But a is outside the ETI yet b is inside it.
```{r eti3, echo = FALSE}
plot(res_vec,
     type = "eti",
     xlim = c(0, 40),
     ylim = c(0, 0.11),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     xlab = "Recruitment (billions of age-0 fish)",
     arrowhead_gap = 0.1,
	 y_arrow = 2,
	 explanatory_lines_a_b = TRUE)
```

## Equal-tailed intervals -- usual approach

All values in range c are *more* likely than all in range d.

But c is outside the ETI yet d is inside.

This is "Intuitively undesirable" Kruschke (2015).
```{r eti4, echo = FALSE}
plot(res_vec,
     type = "eti",
     xlim = c(0, 40),
     ylim = c(0, 0.11),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     xlab = "Recruitment (billions of age-0 fish)",
     arrowhead_gap = 0.1,
	 y_arrow = 2,
	 show_a_b = FALSE,
	 explanatory_lines_extra = TRUE)
```

# HDI

## Highest density interval (HDI) -- alternative approach

Horizontal line rising until area in blue is 95%. This is 99%:

```{r hdi99, echo = FALSE}
plot(create_intervals(rec_2021, credibility = 0.99),
     type = "hdi",
     xlim = c(0, 40),
     ylim = c(0, 0.11),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     xlab = "Recruitment (billions of age-0 fish)",
     arrowhead_gap = 0.1)
```

## Highest density interval (HDI) -- alternative approach

Horizontal line rising until area in blue is 95%. This is 98%:

```{r hdi98, echo = FALSE}
plot(create_intervals(rec_2021, credibility = 0.98),
     type = "hdi",
     xlim = c(0, 40),
     ylim = c(0, 0.11),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     xlab = "Recruitment (billions of age-0 fish)",
     arrowhead_gap = 0.1)
```

## Highest density interval (HDI) -- alternative approach

Horizontal line rising until area in blue is 95%. This is 97%:

```{r hdi97, echo = FALSE}
plot(create_intervals(rec_2021, credibility = 0.97),
     type = "hdi",
     xlim = c(0, 40),
     ylim = c(0, 0.11),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     xlab = "Recruitment (billions of age-0 fish)",
     arrowhead_gap = 0.1)
```

## Highest density interval (HDI) -- alternative approach

Horizontal line rising until area in blue is 95%. This is 96%:

```{r hdi96, echo = FALSE}
plot(create_intervals(rec_2021, credibility = 0.96),
     type = "hdi",
     xlim = c(0, 40),
     ylim = c(0, 0.11),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     xlab = "Recruitment (billions of age-0 fish)",
     arrowhead_gap = 0.1)
```

## Highest density interval (HDI) -- alternative approach

Horizontal line rising until area in blue is 95%. This is 95%:

```{r hdi95, echo = FALSE}
plot(res_vec,
     type = "hdi",
     xlim = c(0, 40),
     ylim = c(0, 0.11),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     xlab = "Recruitment (billions of age-0 fish)",
     arrowhead_gap = 0.1)
```

## Highest density interval (HDI) -- alternative approach

All values within HDI are `r colorize("more likely than all those outside it")`.

HDI is the `r colorize("shortest")` of all possible 95% credible intervals.

```{r hdi3, echo = FALSE}
plot(res_vec,
     type = "hdi",
     xlim = c(0, 40),
     ylim = c(0, 0.11),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     xlab = "Recruitment (billions of age-0 fish)",
     arrowhead_gap = 0.1)
```



# ETI & HDI

## Comparing ETI and HDI

```{r, both, echo=FALSE}
par(mai = c(0.32, 0.3, 0.15, 0.12),
    mfrow = c(2,1),
    mgp = c(1.6,0.5,0),
    cex = 0.6)

plot(res_vec,
     type = "eti",
     xlim = c(0, 40),
     ylim = c(0, 0.11),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     xlab = "Recruitment (billions of age-0 fish)",
     arrowhead_gap = 0.1)

mtext("A. Equal-tailed interval", side = 3, adj = 0, cex = 0.7,
line = 0.3)

plot(res_vec,
     type = "hdi",
     xlim = c(0, 40),
     ylim = c(0, 0.11),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     xlab = "Recruitment (billions of age-0 fish)",
     arrowhead_gap = 0.1)

mtext("B. Highest density interval", side = 3, adj = 0, cex = 0.7,
        line = 0.3)
```

## Comparing ETI and HDI

| Type | Interval | Interval width |
| :-------| -----:| -----:|
| ETI     | 4.1 -- 29.5 | 25.4 |
| HDI     | 2.8 -- 25.2 | 22.4 |

So the HDI reduces uncertainty by 3 billion fish.


## Estimated recruitment through time

```{r, recyears, echo = FALSE}
res_all_years <- create_intervals(dplyr::select(hake_recruitment_mcmc,
                                                -"Virgin"))
res_all_years_2 <- create_intervals(hake_relative_biomass_mcmc)

# par("mai" = c(1.02, 0.82, 0.1, 0.42)) orig
# par(mai = c(0.32, 0.3, 0.15, 0.12),  twopanel

```

Just plotting the 95% credible intervals (and medians) for each year:
```{r, recyearsplot, fig.height = 4.5, echo = FALSE}
plot(res_all_years,
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Recruitment (billions of fish)")
```

## Estimated relative spawning biomass

Relative spawning biomass for each year, 95% credible intervals
>0.4 is healthy zone:
```{r biomassseries, fig.height = 4.5, echo = FALSE}
plot(res_all_years_2,
     xlim = c(2010, 2027),
     ylim = c(0, 2.6),
     add_line_at_0.4 = TRUE,
     inc = 0.05,
     leg_loc = "topleft",
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Relative spawning biomass")
```

## Estimated relative spawning biomass

Relative spawning biomass for each year, 50% credible intervals:
```{r biomassseries50, fig.height = 4.5, echo = FALSE}
res_all_years_3 <- create_intervals(hake_relative_biomass_mcmc, credibility = 0.5)

plot(res_all_years_3,
     xlim = c(2010, 2027),
     ylim = c(0, 2.6),
     add_line_at_0.4 = TRUE,
     inc = 0.05,
     leg_loc = "topleft",
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Relative spawning biomass")
```

## Decision tables

Advice is also in the form of 'decision tables' that indicate probabilities of future events given
different catches. Simplified example:

| Catch (t) in 2024 | Probability spawning biomass declines from 2023 to 2024 | Probability spawning biomass in 2024 falls below 40% of unfished biomass |
| ----------------: | ------------------------------------------------------: | -----------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| 0 | 50% | 2% |
| 180,000 | 72% | 3% |
| 225,000 | 75% | 3% |
| 320,000 | 78% | 3% |
| 430,000 | 85% | 5% |

`r colorize("Unaffected by choice of interval, but we don't generally give probabilities for previous years")`

# Other species

## Pacific Herring Strait of Georgia stock

- Bayesian statistical catch-at-age model
- relative spawning biomass is $B/B_0$
- recruitment is for `r colorize("age-2 herring")`
- critical zone is relative spawning biomass < 0.3
- `r colorize("90\\%")` credible intervals

## Pacific Herring Strait of Georgia stock -- recruitment

```{r herringrec, echo = FALSE}
credibility_herring <- 0.90
res_all_years_herring_rec <- create_intervals(herring_recruitment_sog_mcmc,
                                              credibility = credibility_herring)

     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Recruitment (billions of age-2 fish)",
     leg_loc = "topleft",
     y_tick_by = 0.5)
```

## Pacific Herring Strait of Georgia stock -- recruitment



- Slight lowering of the HDIs compared to the usual ETIs.

- Sum of the differences over all years between the width of the ETI and width of
the HDI is `r colorize("1.6 billion fish")`

- Across all five Pacific Herring major stocks, sum of differences is `r colorize("4.6 billion fish")`

## Pacific Herring -- relative spawning biomass

```{r calcherringrelbiomass, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = FALSE}
herring_relative_biomass_sog <- herring_biomass_sog_mcmc /
  herring_unfished_biomass_sog_mcmc

  dplyr::select(-`2024`)
res_all_years_herring_relative_biomass <- create_intervals(herring_relative_biomass_sog,
                                          credibility = credibility_herring)
```

0.3 is limit reference point

     add_line = 0.3,
     add_line_col = "darkred",

```

## Petrale Sole

- Bayesian delay-difference model
- combines three different models that assumed different values of natural mortality (with 50% of total samples coming from one
model and 25% from each of the other two)
- relative spawning biomass is $B/B_{msy}$
- critical zone is $B/B_{msy} < 0.4$
- 95% credible intervals

## Pacific Cod (Area 3CD stock, west coast of Vancouver Island)

- Bayesian delay-difference model
- results from seven models (different
parameter settings) were combined, 1,000 MCMC samples from each, yielding 7,000
MCMC samples
- upper stock reference point: the mean of the biomass estimates from
1956–2004
- lower reference point: lowest estimated biomass agreed
upon as an undesirable state to be avoided, defined as estimated biomass in
1986
- 95% credible intervals

## Pacific Cod - recruitment

```{r, recruitment, echo = FALSE}

that the intervals do change when looking at `r colorize("absolute")` spawning biomass:

# Summary

## Discussion

Occasional uses of HDIs in marine ecology include:

- estimates of global fisheries
- analysis of salmon migration
- development of stock assessment methods
- summaries of biological and environmental data relating relating to Atlantic Cod
- estimating population sizes of sharks and whales
- one example in a fisheries stock assessment


Advantages of HDIs over ETIs not investigated or discussed.


## Discussion

In general, ETI previously recommended because:

\medskip

(i) it has a direct interpretation as the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles.

\medskip

(ii) it is invariant to nonlinear transformations of the data.

\medskip

(iii) it is easier to compute.

## Discussion

In general, ETI previously recommended because:

\medskip

(i) it has a direct interpretation as the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles.

**Yes, but simplicity has downsides as shown earlier**

\medskip

\pause

(ii) it is invariant to nonlinear transformations of the data.

**Yes, but usually quantities are defined on the scale of interest**

\medskip

\pause

(iii) it is easier to compute.

**Yes, but our new hdiAnalysis package helps, building upon HDInterval**

Thus, we recommend investigating the use of HDIs in stock assessments.
