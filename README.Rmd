<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file.
Build with

load_all()
rmarkdown::render("README.Rmd")

which builds the .html that can be viewed locally (but isn't pushed to GitHub;
GitHub uses README.md to make the page you see on GitHub). See pacea if want to
save figures.

An R package for calculating and plotting highest density intervals

**UNDER DEVELOPMENT** Will likely not make any sense yet to anyone else yet!



The `report` folder contains early exploratory investigations and analyses for
other examples not included in the manuscript, and are not intended for packages
users (all the data are not pushed to GitHub so the code likely can't be run
anyway).

## Installation

Okay, if you're convinced this package might be useful for you, then to install
the latest version just:

```
install.packages("remotes")    # If you do not already have the "remotes" package

remotes::install_github("andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis")
```

If you get an error like
```
Error in utils::download.file(....)
```
then the connection may be timing out (happens to us on the DFO network). Try

```
options(timeout = 1200)
```
and then try and install again. If you get a different error then post an Issue
or contact <a href="mailto:andrew.edwards@dfo-mpo.gc.ca">Andy</a> for help.
