An R package for calculating and plotting highest density intervals

This package accompanies the paper:

*Using highest density intervals can reduce perceived uncertainty in
  stock assessments*

by Andrew M. Edwards and Marie Auger-Méthé, *Fisheries Research*
285:107326. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2025.107326

In the paper we show that using highest density
intervals (HDIs) to characterise uncertainty can be preferable to using the usual
equal-tailed intervals. The HDIs are shorter (reduce the perceived uncertainty) and can lead to
potential management implications by changing perceptions of stock status.

This package provides functionality to calculate, understand, and plot highest
density intervals. The paper is a Short Communication (<4.5 pages) and should be
read first to understand the ideas and the applications of the package (further
technical details are in the [Supplementary
Material](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0165783625000633-mmc1.pdf)).

Our package builds upon and adds functionality (e.g. our plotting functions) to the popular HDInterval package
by Meredith and Kruschke (2022): HDInterval: Highest (Posterior) Density Intervals.
https://cran.r-project.org/package=HDInterval, for which the source code is viewable at
https://github.com/mikemeredith/HDInterval.

## Vignettes

Three vignettes for hdiAnalysis are designed to help users investigate
highest density intervals for their own applications. The vignettes include
examples of our simple plotting functions to help understand and
check calculated HDIs, plus code to streamline the calculation of HDIs for time
series of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) values and to produce simple summary
tables of results. All results in the manuscript are reproducible in the vignettes.

The three vignettes  are rendered and viewable on GitHub at:

* [results.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/blob/main/vignettes/results.html)
  -- Designed as a template for users to analyse their own data, by reproducing
  the main Pacific Hake results in the manuscript as an example.
* [results-extra.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/blob/main/vignettes/results-extra.html)
  -- Includes further results, calculations, explanations, and figure options.
* [results-herring-petrale-cod.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/blob/main/vignettes/results-herring-petrale-cod.html)
  -- Calculations for three further stocks, Pacific Herring, Petrale Sole, and Pacific Cod.

To run and adapt the code yourself, simply download the raw R Markdown files
from
[results.Rmd](https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/blob/main/vignettes/results.Rmd),
[results-extra.Rmd](https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/blob/main/vignettes/results-extra.Rmd),
or
[results-herring-petrale-cod.Rmd](https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/blob/main/vignettes/results-herring-petrale-cod.Rmd).
Run the file locally, and then adapt it for your own data.

## Citation

If you use `hdiAnalysis` in your work then please cite the paper, and also the
package as:

Edwards, A.M. and Auger-Méthé, M. (2025). hdiAnalysis: An R package for
  calculating and plotting highest density intervals. R package
  version 1.0.0, <https://github.com/andrew-edwards/HDIanalysis>.

This will give us motivation for updating and maintaining it in the future.
`citation("hdiAnalysis")` to get a version for LaTeX and R Markdown
bibliographies.
<!-- Although the DOI badge at the top of this page ends in ...805,
the ...804 DOI is preferable because that will not change with any future
updates to the GitHub tag. So ...804 seems simpler and more consistent to use -->
<!-- (thanks!). -->

Also let us know of any applications. This will help us devote effort into
maintaining `hdiAnalysis`. Please report any bugs or suggestions as [an Issue](https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/issues).

## Extra code

The [talks/](https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/tree/dev-andy/talks) folder contains `.Rmd` code, and rendered `.pdf` files, for
presentations.

The [report/](https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/tree/dev-andy/report) folder contains early exploratory investigations and analyses for
other examples not included in the manuscript, and are not intended for package
users (all the data are not pushed to GitHub so the code likely can't be run
anyway).

## Installation

To install the latest version just:

```
install.packages("remotes")    # If you do not already have the "remotes" package

remotes::install_github("andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis")
```

If you get an error like
```
Error in utils::download.file(....)
```
then the connection may be timing out (this can especially happen on a work network). Try

```
options(timeout = 1200)
```
and then try and install again. If the R-CMD-check badge above has a green
"passing" component then the package has been independently tested and installed
via a GitHub Action, and so should install fine to your local machine. If you
encounter problems then either  post an Issue
or contact <a href="mailto:andrew.edwards@dfo-mpo.gc.ca">Andy</a> for help.
