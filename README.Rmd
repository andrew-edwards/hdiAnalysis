An R package for calculating and plotting highest density intervals

This package accompanies the manuscript:

*Using highest density intervals can reduce perceived uncertainty in
  stock assessments*

by Andrew M. Edwards and Marie Auger-Méthé, submitted to
*Fisheries Research*.

In the manuscript (available upon request) we show that using highest density
intervals (HDIs) to characterise uncertainty can be preferable to using the usual
equal-tailed intervals. The HDIs are shorter (less uncertainty) and can also lead to
unanticipated conservation implications by changing perceptions of stock status.

This package provides functionality to calculate, understand, and plot highest
density intervals. The manuscript should be read first to understand the potential of the
package. Three rendered vignettes are designed to help users investigate
highest density intervals for their own applications. The vignettes include
examples of our simple plotting functions to help understand and
check calculated HDIs, plus code to streamline the calculation of HDIs for time
series of (Markov chain Monte Carlo) MCMC
values and to produce simple summary tables of results. All results in the
manuscript are reproducible in the vignettes.

The three vignettes are rendered and viewable on the GitHub site, and are:

* [results.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/blob/main/vignettes/results.html)
  -- Designed as a template for users to analyse their own data, by reproducing
  the main Pacific Hake results in
  the manuscript as an example.
* [results-extra.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/blob/main/vignettes/results-extra.html)
  -- Includes further results, calculations, explanations, and figure options.
* [results-herring-petrale-cod.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/blob/main/vignettes/results-herring-petrale-cod.html)
  -- Calculations for three further stocks, Pacific Herring, Petrale Sole, and
  Pacific Cod.


To run and adapt the code yourself, simply download the raw R Markdown files
from
[results.Rmd](https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/blob/main/vignettes/results.Rmd),
[results-extra.Rmd](https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/blob/main/vignettes/results-extra.Rmd),
or
[results-herring-petrale-cod.Rmd](https://github.com/andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis/blob/main/vignettes/results-herring-petrale-cod.Rmd).
Run the file locally, and then adapt it for your own data.

## Installation

To install the latest version just:

```
install.packages("remotes")    # If you do not already have the "remotes" package

remotes::install_github("andrew-edwards/hdiAnalysis")
```

If you get an error like
```
Error in utils::download.file(....)
```
then the connection may be timing out (this happens to us on the DFO network). Try

```
options(timeout = 1200)
```
and then try and install again. If you get a different error then post an Issue
or contact <a href="mailto:andrew.edwards@dfo-mpo.gc.ca">Andy</a> for help.

## Citation

If you use `hdiAnalysis` in your work then please cite the manuscript, and also the
package as:

Edwards, A.M. and Auger-Méthé, M. (2025). hdiAnalysis: An R package for
  calculating and plotting highest density intervals. R package
  version 1.0.0, <https://github.com/andrew-edwards/HDIanalysis>.

This will give us motivation for updating and maintaining it in the future.
`citation("hdiAnalysis")` to get a version for LaTeX and R Markdown
bibliographies. We will add a DOI if the manuscript is accepted.
<!-- Although the DOI badge at the top of this page ends in ...805,
the ...804 DOI is preferable because that will not change with any future
updates to the GitHub tag. So ...804 seems simpler and more consistent to use -->
<!-- (thanks!). -->

Also let us know of any applications. This will help us devote effort into
maintaining `hdiAnalysis`.



The `report` folder contains early exploratory investigations and analyses for
other examples not included in the manuscript, and are not intended for packages
users (all the data are not pushed to GitHub so the code likely can't be run
anyway).
